# Competitive Intelligence

## Overview

At $1M-5M ARR, buyers compare you to 3-5 alternatives in every deal. This skill builds an always-on competitive intelligence system that feeds real-time insight into sales enablement, positioning, content, and GTM decisions.

## When to Use

- Sales reps encounter competitive objections without current intel
- Win rates against specific competitors are declining
- A new competitor enters your space or an adjacent player expands into it
- Competitor has changed pricing, features, or positioning
- Preparing comparison or alternative content for SEO/GEO
- Building or refreshing sales battlecards
- Lost deal analysis shows "competitor chosen" as a growing reason
- Entering a new segment where the competitive landscape is unfamiliar

**Don't use when:** You have current (<3 months) competitor profiles, battlecards are actively used by sales, and monitoring system is running with no major competitive events.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Competitive landscape mapping | Day 1-2 | Competitive Landscape Map |
| Deep competitor profiles | Day 3-5 | Competitor Profiles (top 3-5) |
| Battlecard creation | Day 6-7 | Sales Battlecards per competitor |
| Always-on monitoring system | Week 2 | Monitoring System + Alert Framework |
| Competitive content strategy | Week 2-3 | Competitive Content Plan |

## Core Deliverables

- **Competitive Landscape Map** -- Direct, indirect, and emerging competitors categorized with positioning, funding, and differentiators
- **Deep Competitor Profiles** -- Company overview, product, positioning, GTM strategy, customers, and win/loss patterns for top 3-5 competitors
- **Sales Battlecards** -- Per-competitor cards with quick summary, when we win/lose, differentiators, objection handling, landmines, and proof points
- **Always-On Monitoring System** -- Automated tracking of pricing, features, positioning, funding, hires, content, and review changes
- **Competitive Content Plan** -- Comparison pages, alternative pages, category pages, and migration guides

## Common Mistakes

- Building static quarterly reports instead of always-on monitoring
- Trash-talking competitors (buyers see through it; acknowledge strengths, position on genuine advantages)
- Obsessing over feature parity instead of competing on outcomes, speed, and focus
- Ignoring "do nothing" as a competitor (inertia is often the biggest rival at this stage)
- Keeping intel siloed in marketing where sales never sees it
- Faking confidence on low-quality data (label confidence levels honestly)

## Integration

**Feeds into:** building-positioning-messaging, designing-gtm-strategy, creating-sales-enablement, running-content-engine, optimizing-geo-visibility, reducing-cac

**Refresh:** Competitor profiles full refresh every 6 months. Battlecards continuous updates, full review quarterly. Monitoring system always-on, reviewed weekly. Win/loss competitive analysis monthly.
