# ICP Definition & Segmentation

## Overview

ICP is the single highest-leverage decision in a $1M-5M ARR business. This skill turns customer research into a precise, tiered targeting framework that tells every downstream function exactly who to pursue, who to deprioritize, and who to reject.

## When to Use

- Targeting feels unfocused or overly broad ("we serve everyone")
- CAC is high relative to benchmarks and LTV
- Churn analysis reveals bad-fit customers are being acquired
- ICP exists only as founder intuition, not documented and validated
- Entering a new market or segment
- Conversion rates are low despite sufficient traffic
- Sales team lacks clear qualification criteria
- Preparing to build positioning, GTM strategy, or content engine

**Don't use when:** You have a validated, data-backed ICP from the last 6 months with no market changes or new segment entry.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Data assembly | Day 1 | Customer Scoring Matrix |
| Pattern extraction | Day 2 | ICP Pattern Analysis |
| ICP framework build | Day 3 | Tiered ICP Document + Negative ICP |
| Buyer persona development | Day 4 | Persona Profiles per ICP Tier |
| Validation & operationalization | Week 2 | Validated ICP in CRM + Team Training |

## Core Deliverables

- **Tiered ICP Document** -- Tier 1 (perfect fit), Tier 2 (good fit), Tier 3 (acceptable), with firmographic, technographic, and behavioral criteria per tier
- **Negative ICP** -- Disqualification signals with evidence from bottom-20% customer data
- **Buyer Personas** -- Role-specific profiles within each ICP tier (champion, economic buyer, technical buyer, end user, blocker)
- **Customer Scoring Matrix** -- Every customer scored and tiered by health score

## Common Mistakes

- Building ICP from assumptions instead of data (skip customer research and your ICP is fiction)
- Making ICP too broad ("10-10,000 employees" is not an ICP)
- Ignoring negative ICP (knowing who to reject is as valuable as knowing who to pursue)
- Confusing personas with ICP (ICP = company fit, persona = people within those companies)
- Setting and forgetting (revisit quarterly with fresh data)
- Optimizing for TAM size over segment dominance

## Integration

**Feeds into:** gathering-competitive-intel, building-positioning-messaging, designing-gtm-strategy, developing-brand-strategy, planning-marketing-budget, running-content-engine, creating-sales-enablement, reducing-cac, accelerating-pipeline

**Refresh:** Full ICP review every 6 months. Scoring model recalibration quarterly. Pipeline audit vs. ICP monthly. Persona refresh every 6 months.
