name: growing-nrr
description: Use when net revenue retention is below 110%, when churn patterns are reactive instead of predictive, when expansion revenue lacks systematic triggers, when onboarding fails to reach activation milestones, or when customer health scoring does not exist. Use when customer base is large enough for patterns (50-500 accounts) but retention is managed manually.

# NRR Engine (Net Revenue Retention)

## Overview

NRR is the single metric that most reliably predicts SaaS survival and valuation. This skill builds health scoring, onboarding flows, expansion triggers, churn prediction, and community retention that turn your existing customer base into your most efficient growth engine.

## When to Use

- NRR is below 110% and needs systematic improvement
- Customer health scoring does not exist or relies on login frequency
- Onboarding is generic and activation rates are low
- Expansion revenue is opportunistic, not trigger-based
- Churn is detected at renewal time instead of predicted early
- Customer feedback is scattered with no synthesis

**Don't use when:** NRR is above 120% with health scoring, expansion triggers, and predictive churn models already operating.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Customer health scoring model | Week 1 | Health model with signals, weights, thresholds |
| Personalized onboarding at scale | Week 2 | Activation milestone map and segmented paths |
| Customer feedback synthesis | Week 3 | Monthly synthesis report with prioritized themes |
| Automated expansion triggers | Week 3-4 | Trigger definitions, conditions, and routing |
| Churn prediction and prevention | Week 4-5 | Cohort analysis, predictive signals, intervention playbooks |
| Community as retention moat | Week 5-6 | Community strategy and retention programs |

## Core Deliverables

- **Customer Health Scoring Model** -- Multi-signal scoring with thresholds and routing rules
- **Onboarding Flow Design** -- Segmented activation paths with milestone-based intervention triggers
- **Customer Feedback Synthesis** -- Monthly report aggregating all sources into prioritized, revenue-weighted themes
- **Expansion Trigger Workflows** -- Usage, feature, team, milestone, and stakeholder-based triggers tied to health scores
- **Churn Prediction Model** -- Cohort analysis, predictive signals, intervention playbooks, and win-back campaigns
- **Community Retention Plan** -- Ecosystem switching costs through templates, peer connections, and expertise investment

## Common Mistakes

- Using login frequency as health score (depth and breadth matter, not volume)
- Running calendar-based QBRs instead of signal-based outreach
- Treating all churn the same (poor-fit churn is healthy; Tier 1 churn is an emergency)
- Attempting to upsell unhappy customers (fix health below 70 first)
- Single-threading on one champion (one departure away from churn)
- Building generic onboarding for all segments
- Ignoring churned customers (10-15% will return with the right timing)

## Integration

**Feeds into:** tracking-marketing-metrics, managing-marketing-ops

**Refresh:** Health model quarterly. Onboarding monthly. Feedback synthesis monthly. Expansion triggers monthly. Churn model quarterly. Full NRR strategy review every 6 months.
