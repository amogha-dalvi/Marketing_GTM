## Purpose

Positioning is the strategic decision of how you want to exist in your buyer's mind. Messaging is the language system that communicates that position. Together they are the atomic unit of marketing — every landing page, ad, sales conversation, and piece of content either reinforces or dilutes your position. At $1M-5M ARR, nailing positioning is often the difference between efficient growth and expensive chaos.

---

## Business Context ($1M-5M ARR)

- You've found PMF but your positioning may still be founder-intuitive rather than market-validated
- Messaging is likely inconsistent — different reps say different things, website doesn't match sales pitch
- You're probably positioned too broadly ("we help everyone") or too narrowly for growth
- Competitors are actively trying to reposition you ("they're just a feature, not a platform")
- Your customers describe what you do better than your marketing team does
- AI search engines are forming opinions about what you do based on how others describe you
- Getting this right now prevents expensive repositioning later

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Positioning Inputs Assembly (Day 1)

**Objective:** Gather everything needed to make positioning decisions.

**Required inputs from upstream skills:**

From [Customer Research](./01-customer-research.md):
- Customer Voice Library (exact language customers use)
- JTBD Map (what jobs customers hire you for)
- Buying Journey Map (how they find and evaluate you)

From [ICP Definition](./02-icp-definition.md):
- Tier 1 ICP profile (who you're positioning for)
- Buyer personas (who specifically you're talking to)
- Negative ICP (who you're NOT for)

From [Competitive Intel](./03-competitive-intel.md):
- Competitor positioning maps (how alternatives position themselves)
- Win/loss patterns (why you win and lose)
- Competitive whitespace (positions no one owns)

**Additional inputs:**
- Current website copy, sales decks, and marketing materials
- Product capabilities and roadmap (next 6-12 months)
- Founder's vision for the company (where you're going, not just where you are)

### Phase 2: Positioning Strategy (Day 2-3)

**Objective:** Make the core strategic decisions about how you'll position.

**Step 1: Category Decision**

This is the most important positioning decision. You're choosing which mental box buyers put you in.

| Option | When to Use | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Existing category** | Category is established, buyers search for it | "Project management software" |
| **Subcategory** | Too much noise in the main category, you serve a niche | "Project management for creative agencies" |
| **New category** | No existing category fits, you solve a problem nobody has a name for | "Revenue intelligence platform" |
| **Category + modifier** | You're in a known category but differentiated | "AI-native [category]" |

**Decision framework:**
- If buyers already search for your category → own the subcategory for your ICP
- If buyers describe the problem but not a category → you may need to create one
- If you create a category, budget 2-3x for education (risky at $1M-5M ARR)
- Test: Can you explain your category in <5 seconds? If not, simplify.

**Step 2: Competitive Positioning Matrix**

Map your position relative to alternatives:

```
        [Axis 1: Primary buying criterion — e.g., Ease of Use]
        Low ←─────────────────────────────→ High
High ┌──────────────────────────────────────┐
     │                    │                 │
[A   │    Competitor A    │   ★ YOU ★       │
x    │                    │                 │
i    │────────────────────│─────────────────│
s    │                    │                 │
     │    Status Quo      │   Competitor B  │
2]   │    (do nothing)    │                 │
Low  └──────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Choose axes that:
1. Reflect what your ICP actually cares about (from Customer Research)
2. Show clear differentiation (you're not in the same quadrant as competitors)
3. Are defensible (you can prove your position with evidence)

**Step 3: Value Proposition Architecture**

```
Primary Value Proposition (company level):
"We help [ICP] achieve [primary outcome] by [unique mechanism],
unlike [alternative] which [limitation]."

Supporting Value Props (pillar level):
├── Pillar 1: [Key benefit] — backed by [proof point]
├── Pillar 2: [Key benefit] — backed by [proof point]
└── Pillar 3: [Key benefit] — backed by [proof point]

Each pillar maps to:
- A primary JTBD from Customer Research
- A key differentiator from Competitive Intel
- A measurable outcome the buyer cares about
```

**Validation Tests:**
- [ ] Does the value prop use customer language? (from Voice Library)
- [ ] Can a buyer understand it in <10 seconds?
- [ ] Is it differentiated? (would a competitor say the same thing?)
- [ ] Is it provable? (do you have evidence for every claim?)
- [ ] Does it address the primary JTBD?

### Phase 3: Messaging Architecture (Day 4-5)

**Objective:** Build the complete language system that cascades from positioning.

**Messaging Hierarchy:**

```
Level 1: NARRATIVE (brand story — used in keynotes, about page, PR)
│
├── Level 2: VALUE PROPOSITION (company-level — used on homepage, elevator pitch)
│   │
│   ├── Level 3: PILLAR MESSAGES (benefit-level — used on feature pages, campaigns)
│   │   │
│   │   ├── Level 4: PROOF POINTS (evidence — used everywhere to back claims)
│   │   │   ├── Customer quotes
│   │   │   ├── Metrics / data
│   │   │   ├── Case studies
│   │   │   └── Third-party validation
│   │   │
│   │   └── Level 5: TACTICAL COPY (execution — used in ads, emails, CTAs)
│   │       ├── Headlines
│   │       ├── Taglines
│   │       ├── Email subject lines
│   │       └── Ad copy variants
```

**Messaging by Persona (from ICP Definition):**

For each buyer persona, create a messaging variant:

| Element | Champion | Economic Buyer | Technical Buyer |
|---------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| Primary pain | [their specific pain] | [their specific pain] | [their specific pain] |
| Desired outcome | [their goal] | [their goal] | [their goal] |
| Key message | [what resonates] | [what resonates] | [what resonates] |
| Proof point | [what convinces] | [what convinces] | [what convinces] |
| Objection | [their hesitation] | [their hesitation] | [their hesitation] |
| Objection response | [address it] | [address it] | [address it] |

**Messaging by Funnel Stage:**

| Stage | Buyer Mindset | Message Focus | Example |
|-------|--------------|---------------|---------|
| Unaware | Doesn't know the problem exists | Problem education, empathy | "Most [role] spend [X hours] on [pain] without realizing..." |
| Problem-aware | Knows the problem, not the solution | Agitate pain, introduce approach | "There's a better way to [achieve outcome]" |
| Solution-aware | Knows solutions exist, evaluating | Differentiation, value props | "Unlike [alternatives], [product] [unique mechanism]" |
| Product-aware | Knows your product, deciding | Proof, risk removal, urgency | "[Customer] achieved [metric] in [timeframe]" |
| Most-aware | Ready to buy | Offer, CTA, friction removal | "Start free. See results in [timeframe]." |

### Phase 4: Messaging Document Build (Day 6)

**Objective:** Create the master messaging document.

**Master Messaging Doc Structure:**

```
# [Product] Messaging Guide

## 1. Positioning Statement
[Internal-facing, strategic — not customer-facing copy]
For [target audience] who [situation/need],
[product] is a [category] that [key benefit].
Unlike [primary alternative], we [key differentiator].

## 2. Elevator Pitch (10 seconds)
[What to say when someone asks "what does your company do?"]

## 3. Boilerplate (50 words)
[For press releases, partner pages, directory listings]

## 4. Value Proposition Headlines
- Primary: [main headline]
- Variant A: [alternative angle]
- Variant B: [alternative angle]

## 5. Pillar Messages
### Pillar 1: [Name]
- Message: [one sentence]
- Supporting proof: [evidence]
- Customer quote: [from Voice Library]

### Pillar 2: [Name]
[same structure]

### Pillar 3: [Name]
[same structure]

## 6. Persona-Specific Messaging
[One section per persona from ICP Definition]

## 7. Competitive Messaging
[Key messages per competitor from Competitive Intel]

## 8. Words We Use / Words We Don't
| Use | Don't Use | Why |
|-----|-----------|-----|
| [customer language] | [jargon] | [reason] |

## 9. Proof Points Library
[All evidence assets organized by claim]

## 10. FAQ / Objection Responses
[Top 10 objections with responses from win/loss data]
```

### Phase 5: Message Testing & Validation (Week 2-3)

**Objective:** Test messaging before deploying across all channels.

**Testing Methods:**

| Method | What It Tests | Speed | Cost |
|--------|--------------|-------|------|
| Customer interviews (3-5) | Does it resonate? Does it match their language? | 1 week | Low |
| A/B test on homepage headline | Which value prop converts best? | 2-4 weeks | Low |
| LinkedIn/social posts | Which angles get engagement? | 1-2 weeks | Free |
| Sales pitch testing | Does the new pitch shorten sales cycles? | 4-8 weeks | Free |
| Paid ad copy testing | Which messages drive CTR and conversion? | 2-4 weeks | Medium |
| Email subject line testing | Which messages drive opens? | 1-2 weeks | Low |

**AI-Assisted Testing Workflow:**
1. Generate 5-10 headline variants from the messaging framework
2. Test 2-3 simultaneously across channels
3. AI analyzes performance data and identifies winning patterns
4. Refine messaging based on data
5. Roll winning messages into the master document

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Homepage conversion rate | Improve 20%+ after messaging update | Message-market fit |
| Sales pitch consistency | >80% of reps using core messages | Operational adoption |
| Brand recall accuracy | Buyers correctly describe what you do | Positioning is landing |
| Competitive differentiation score | Buyers can articulate why you're different | Positioning is working |
| Time-to-pitch | <30 seconds clear explanation | Message simplicity |
| Message A/B test win rate | Improving quarter over quarter | Message refinement |

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- **Don't position by features.** "We have X, Y, and Z features" is not positioning. Position on outcomes.
- **Don't use internal jargon.** If customers don't use the word, neither should you. The Customer Voice Library is your source of truth.
- **Don't try to be everything.** "We're the all-in-one platform for everyone" positions you as nothing for nobody.
- **Don't copy competitor positioning.** If you occupy the same position, you compete on price. Find whitespace.
- **Don't skip testing.** The smartest messaging in a conference room often fails in market. Test fast.
- **Don't change positioning quarterly.** Positioning is a long-term commitment. Messaging can evolve; positioning shouldn't shift without major market data.
- **Don't let product features drive positioning.** Start with customer problems (from Customer Research), not product capabilities.
