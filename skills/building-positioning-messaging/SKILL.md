name: building-positioning-messaging
description: Use when messaging is inconsistent across sales and marketing, homepage conversion is low, buyers cannot articulate what makes you different, or positioning was never formally defined. Use when entering a new category, responding to competitive repositioning, launching a major product, or when customer research reveals a gap between how customers describe you and how you describe yourself.

# Positioning & Messaging Framework

## Overview

Positioning is the strategic decision of how you exist in your buyer's mind. Messaging is the language system that communicates that position. At $1M-5M ARR, nailing positioning is often the difference between efficient growth and expensive chaos.

## When to Use

- Messaging is inconsistent (reps say different things, website doesn't match sales pitch)
- Homepage or landing page conversion rates are low
- Buyers cannot articulate what makes you different
- Positioning was never formally defined beyond founder intuition
- Entering or creating a new product category
- Competitors are actively repositioning you
- Customers describe you better than your marketing team does
- Launching a major product or entering a new segment
- AI search engines are mischaracterizing what you do

**Don't use when:** You have a validated messaging framework from the last 12 months, conversion rates are strong, and sales pitch consistency is above 80%.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Positioning inputs assembly | Day 1 | Inputs Brief |
| Positioning strategy | Day 2-3 | Category Decision, Positioning Matrix, Value Props |
| Messaging architecture | Day 4-5 | Messaging Hierarchy by persona and stage |
| Messaging document build | Day 6 | Master Messaging Guide |
| Message testing & validation | Week 2-3 | Tested messaging with performance data |

## Core Deliverables

- **Positioning Statement** -- Internal-facing strategic position: category, target, key benefit, differentiator
- **Value Proposition Architecture** -- Primary value prop plus 3 supporting pillars mapped to JTBD and differentiators
- **Master Messaging Guide** -- Elevator pitch, boilerplate, headlines, pillar messages, persona and competitive messaging, proof points, objection responses
- **Messaging by Persona** -- Tailored pain, outcome, proof, and objection handling per buyer role
- **Messaging by Funnel Stage** -- Awareness-appropriate language from unaware through most-aware

## Common Mistakes

- Positioning by features instead of outcomes
- Using internal jargon customers never use (Customer Voice Library is the source of truth)
- Trying to be everything to everyone ("all-in-one platform for everyone" = nothing for nobody)
- Copying competitor positioning (same position = price competition)
- Skipping testing (conference-room messaging often fails in market)
- Changing positioning quarterly (positioning is long-term; messaging can evolve)
- Letting features drive positioning instead of customer problems

## Integration

**Feeds into:** designing-gtm-strategy, developing-brand-strategy, running-content-engine, optimizing-geo-visibility, creating-sales-enablement, executing-launch-playbook, reducing-cac

**Refresh:** Positioning review annually. Messaging document update quarterly. Message testing continuous. Persona messaging refresh every 6 months. Proof points update monthly.
