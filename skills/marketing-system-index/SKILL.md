## How to Use

**Starting from scratch:** Execute Layer 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5. Sequential within Layer 0, parallel within all other layers.

**Optimizing existing marketing:** Find your target outcome above, check upstream dependencies, fill gaps first.

**Each skill has:** SKILL.md (concise overview, <500 words) + workflow.md (detailed execution guide with templates). Vertical overlays (like marketing-healthcare-vertical) also include a `references/` subdirectory with deep-dive documents.

**Marketing healthtech B2B2C?** Apply marketing-healthcare-vertical alongside every other skill — it adapts the entire system for healthcare buyers, compliance, channels, and the B2B2C value chain.

## Design Principles

1. **Outcome-driven** — every skill moves a business metric
2. **AI-native** — 1-3 person team executes what used to require 10+
3. **Data-informed** — Layer 0 exists because everything else is guesswork without customer data
4. **Interconnected** — skills share outputs via explicit integration points
5. **Built for $1M-5M ARR** — limited budgets, small teams, existential allocation decisions
6. **Current for 2026** — GEO, AI agents, signal-based engagement, buying-group orchestration
