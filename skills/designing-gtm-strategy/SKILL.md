# GTM Strategy & Growth Architecture

## Overview

GTM strategy is the orchestration layer that turns upstream insights into an operational plan: what to do, in what order, through which channels, to hit revenue targets. At $1M-5M ARR, this is the difference between a coherent growth engine and disconnected tactics that burn cash.

## When to Use

- Marketing lacks a clear connection between activities and revenue targets
- No revenue contribution model exists
- Channel selection is based on gut feel, not scored criteria
- Team is spreading effort across too many channels simultaneously
- GTM motion (PLG vs. sales-led vs. hybrid) has not been deliberately chosen
- Entering a new market segment or preparing for next-stage growth
- Pipeline architecture relies on outdated MQL-based funnels

**Don't use when:** You have a validated, data-backed GTM plan less than 90 days old with channels performing to target.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| GTM inputs assembly & revenue math | Day 1 | Revenue contribution model |
| GTM motion selection | Day 2-3 | Motion decision with scoring rationale |
| Channel strategy & prioritization | Day 4-6 | Ranked channels, top 2-3 selected |
| Growth model architecture | Day 7-8 | System diagram, signal architecture |
| GTM sequencing & 90-day plan | Day 9-10 | Phased execution plan |
| Market entry & expansion strategy | Day 11-12 | Depth vs. width decision |

## Core Deliverables

- **Revenue Contribution Model** -- Targets, pipeline requirements, monthly benchmarks
- **GTM Motion Decision** -- PLG vs. sales-led vs. hybrid with scoring rationale
- **Channel Strategy** -- Weighted prioritization matrix, top 2-3 channels selected
- **Growth Model** -- Engine design, compounding loops, signal-based pipeline architecture
- **90-Day Execution Plan** -- Monthly milestones, resource allocation by team size
- **Market Expansion Strategy** -- Depth vs. width framework, emerging channel plan

## Common Mistakes

- Spreading across too many channels (at 1-3 people, do 2-3 well, not 6 poorly)
- Skipping revenue math and jumping straight to tactics
- Copying a competitor's GTM motion instead of scoring fit to your product and ICP
- Building MQL funnels instead of signal-based pipeline architecture
- Scaling a channel before 60-90 days of validated positive ROI
- Planning 12 months in detail instead of 90 days detailed, 6 months directional

## Integration

**Feeds into:** developing-brand-strategy, planning-marketing-budget, running-content-engine, optimizing-geo-visibility, creating-sales-enablement, executing-launch-playbook, reducing-cac, accelerating-pipeline

**Refresh:** Growth model monthly. Channel prioritization and 90-day plan quarterly. Full GTM overhaul annually or after major pivot.
