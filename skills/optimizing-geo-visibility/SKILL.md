# GEO Optimizer (Generative Engine Optimization)

## Overview

GEO gets your brand cited, recommended, and surfaced by AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Google AI Overviews). At $1M-5M ARR, most competitors have not started optimizing for AI citation, making this a compounding first-mover opportunity.

## When to Use

- Brand does not appear when prospects ask AI tools about your category
- Competitors are cited by AI engines but you are not
- AI models describe your product inaccurately or negatively
- No AI visibility audit has been conducted
- Content is not structured for AI extraction and citation
- Technical infrastructure blocks AI crawlers (robots.txt, missing schema, no llms.txt)
- No original research exists for defensible citation

**Don't use when:** You have no content foundation or positioning in place. Build those first.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| AI visibility audit | Day 1-2 | Baseline scorecard across 4 AI platforms |
| GEO content strategy | Day 3-5 | Prioritized content plan optimized for AI citation |
| Earned media strategy | Day 6-8 | Third-party mention plan with outreach calendar |
| Technical GEO implementation | Day 9-10 | llms.txt, schema markup, crawler access config |
| Original research strategy | Day 11-13 | Signature research initiative with distribution plan |
| Monitoring and optimization | Ongoing | Monthly dashboard with competitive AI share of voice |

## Core Deliverables

- **AI Visibility Scorecard** -- Query-by-query analysis across four AI platforms
- **GEO Content Plan** -- Content ranked by citation potential with per-page optimization checklists
- **Earned Media Plan** -- Tiered source strategy (review platforms, media, communities, experts)
- **Technical GEO Checklist** -- llms.txt, schema markup, crawler access, site architecture
- **Original Research Plan** -- Signature annual research asset for defensible citation
- **AI Visibility Dashboard** -- Monthly citation rate, accuracy, and competitive share of voice

## Common Mistakes

- Treating GEO as separate from SEO (76% overlap in cited content)
- Optimizing only your own site when AI models weight third-party sources more heavily
- Blocking AI crawlers in robots.txt
- Creating thin content instead of definitive in-depth guides
- Ignoring inaccurate AI citations that compound in training data
- Skipping community presence (Reddit threads heavily indexed by Perplexity)
- Waiting while competitors build compounding citation equity

## Integration

**Feeds into:** reducing-cac, accelerating-pipeline, tracking-marketing-metrics

**Refresh:** Full audit monthly. Technical audit quarterly. Earned media outreach continuous. Original research annually. Strategy overhaul every 6 months.
