## Purpose

GEO is the brand new marketing discipline — getting your brand cited, recommended, and surfaced by AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini, Google AI Overviews). This is 2026's equivalent of what SEO was in 2010. 89% of B2B buyers now use AI for research before making purchase decisions. Unlike traditional SEO, where you optimize for ranking algorithms, GEO requires you to optimize for being selected, synthesized, and cited by large language models. At $1M-5M ARR, this is the single biggest untapped acquisition channel — your competitors are barely thinking about it, which means the window to establish dominance is right now.

---

## Business Context ($1M-5M ARR)

- 89% of B2B buyers use AI tools (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) during vendor research — if you're invisible here, you don't exist
- AI search engines don't return 10 blue links. They return 1-3 recommendations. You're either cited or you're not
- Most competitors at your stage haven't started thinking about GEO — first-mover advantage is real and compounding
- Your existing SEO foundation matters: 76% of AI-cited content overlaps with Google Page 1-3 results
- What third parties say about you matters MORE to AI models than what you say about yourself
- You don't need a big team for GEO — it's about content structure, earned media, and technical signals
- The cost of inaction is invisible: you won't see the leads you're not getting because AI never recommended you

## Workflow

### Phase 1: AI Visibility Audit (Day 1-2)

**Objective:** Understand exactly where you stand across all AI search platforms right now.

**Required inputs from upstream skills:**

From [Customer Research](./01-customer-research.md):
- JTBD Map (what problems buyers ask AI to solve)
- Language patterns (exact phrases buyers use in AI queries)

From [ICP Definition](./02-icp-definition.md):
- Tier 1 ICP profile (who is searching and what they're searching for)

From [Competitive Intel](./03-competitive-intel.md):
- Competitor list (who else gets cited in AI responses)

From [Positioning & Messaging](./04-positioning-messaging.md):
- Category definition (what category queries should trigger your brand)
- Value propositions (what claims you want AI to associate with you)

**AI Platform Comparison Matrix:**

| Dimension | ChatGPT | Perplexity | Gemini | Google AI Overviews |
|-----------|---------|------------|--------|---------------------|
| **Source preference** | Encyclopedic, authoritative, long-form | Recent, citation-dense, journalism | Google index + knowledge graph | Existing top-ranking content |
| **Content format** | Comprehensive guides, documentation | News, reports, data-rich articles | Structured reference content | Featured snippet-style answers |
| **Update frequency** | Training data + browse capability | Real-time web crawling | Near real-time | Real-time index |
| **Citation style** | Inline references when browsing | Numbered citations for every claim | Embedded links | Links to source pages |
| **Brand mention trigger** | Direct queries, "best tool for X" | Comparative queries, "vs" queries | Factual queries, brand + category | Informational + navigational |
| **Third-party weight** | High — favors Wikipedia, review sites, media | Very high — favors journalism, research | High — favors authoritative domains | High — favors existing rankings |
| **Recency weight** | Moderate | Very high | Moderate | High |
| **How to win** | Be the definitive source, get cited widely | Publish frequently, earn media mentions | Structured data, authoritative backlinks | Rank on Google Page 1-3 |

**GEO Content Audit Workflow:**

1. **Build your query universe (30-50 queries)**
   - Category queries: "best [your category] software," "top [category] tools 2026"
   - Problem queries: "how to solve [pain point your ICP has]"
   - Comparison queries: "[your brand] vs [competitor]," "[competitor A] vs [competitor B]"
   - Job-to-be-done queries: "how to [JTBD from Customer Research]"
   - Alternative queries: "[competitor] alternatives"

2. **Run each query across all four platforms**
   - For each query, record:
     - Were you mentioned? (Yes / No)
     - What position? (1st recommendation, 2nd, mentioned in passing, etc.)
     - What was said about you? (positive, neutral, negative, inaccurate)
     - What source was cited? (your site, review site, media, competitor comparison, Reddit)
     - Who else was mentioned? (competitive context)

3. **Score and categorize results**

   | Category | Criteria | Priority |
   |----------|----------|----------|
   | **You're cited and accurate** | AI mentions you correctly | Protect and amplify |
   | **You're cited but inaccurate** | AI mentions you with wrong info | Urgent fix — correct the record |
   | **You're absent, competitors cited** | AI recommends competitors, not you | High priority — close the gap |
   | **Nobody cited** | AI gives generic advice, no brands | Opportunity — be first |
   | **You're cited negatively** | AI mentions you with caveats/concerns | Urgent fix — address root cause |

4. **Document competitive AI visibility**
   - Which competitors appear most frequently?
   - What sources are AI models pulling from to mention them?
   - What language and claims are associated with each competitor?

**Output:** `geo-visibility-audit.md` — Baseline AI visibility scorecard with query-by-query analysis, competitive comparison, and prioritized gap list.

### Phase 2: GEO Content Strategy (Day 3-5)

**Objective:** Design a content approach optimized for AI citation across all platforms.

**Content Architecture for AI:**

AI models select content for citation based on a fundamentally different set of criteria than Google's traditional ranking algorithm. Understanding these criteria is the foundation of GEO content strategy.

**What AI Models Look For When Selecting Sources:**

```
1. DIRECT ANSWER QUALITY
   Does this content directly answer the user's question
   within the first 40-60 words? AI models extract answers
   from the opening, not buried in paragraph 7.

2. FACT DENSITY
   Does this content contain specific, verifiable claims?
   Statistics, benchmarks, data points every 150-200 words
   signal expertise and give AI something concrete to cite.

3. SOURCE AUTHORITY
   Is this content published on a domain AI models trust?
   Third-party sources (media, review sites, industry analysts)
   dramatically outperform brand-owned content for citation.

4. SEMANTIC COMPLETENESS
   Does this content cover the topic thoroughly? AI models
   prefer sources that address the full scope of a query rather
   than thin, partial answers.

5. STRUCTURAL CLARITY
   Does this content use headers, lists, tables, and structured
   formatting that AI can easily parse and extract from?

6. CITATION NETWORK
   Is this content cited by other credible sources? AI models
   follow the same "trust graph" logic as Google, but amplified.

7. RECENCY
   Is this content current? Especially for Perplexity and Google
   AI Overviews, outdated content gets deprioritized.
```

**GEO Content Types (Ranked by AI Citation Potential):**

| Content Type | AI Citation Potential | Why | Platform Affinity |
|-------------|----------------------|-----|-------------------|
| Original research / benchmark reports | Very High | Unique data AI can't find elsewhere | All platforms |
| Definitive guides (2,000+ words, structured) | High | Semantic completeness, answer density | ChatGPT, Gemini |
| Comparison and alternative pages | High | Direct match to "vs" and "alternative" queries | All platforms |
| Glossary and definition pages | High | Encyclopedic, clear, frequently cited | ChatGPT, Gemini |
| Industry data roundups with citations | High | Fact-dense, cited by others | Perplexity |
| Expert opinion / thought leadership | Medium | Authority signal, but harder to extract facts from | ChatGPT |
| Case studies with specific metrics | Medium | Proof points, but brand-biased | Gemini, Google AI |
| Product documentation | Medium | Technical authority, but narrow scope | ChatGPT |
| Blog posts (opinion, commentary) | Low | Subjective, less extractable | Low across all |
| Product pages / feature lists | Low | Commercial intent, AI distrusts for recommendations | Low across all |

**Content Engineering Checklist (Per Page):**

```

```

**Output:** `geo-content-strategy.md` — Prioritized content plan with target queries, content types, and optimization specifications per piece.

### Phase 3: Earned Media Strategy for AI Citation (Day 6-8)

**Objective:** Build a systematic approach to earning third-party mentions that AI models pull from.

**The Fundamental GEO Truth:**

AI search engines overwhelmingly favor third-party sources over brand-owned content when making recommendations. What others say about you matters MORE than what you say about yourself. This is the biggest departure from traditional SEO, where you could rank your own domain. In GEO, your earned media strategy is more important than your on-site content.

**The AI Citation Source Hierarchy:**

```
Tier 1 — Highest AI Trust (AI cites these most)
├── Major publications (TechCrunch, Forbes, industry-specific media)
├── Wikipedia (if you qualify for a page)
├── Academic/research papers
└── Government/institutional sources

Tier 2 — High AI Trust
├── Industry analyst reports (Gartner, Forrester, G2 category reports)
├── Review platforms (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius)
├── Established industry blogs and newsletters
└── Professional communities (Stack Overflow, relevant subreddits)

Tier 3 — Moderate AI Trust
├── Guest posts on authoritative domains
├── Podcast transcripts and show notes
├── Conference talk transcripts/summaries
└── Partner and integration partner content

Tier 4 — Lower AI Trust (but still valuable)
├── Your own blog and website
├── Your documentation
├── Social media content
└── Press releases
```

**Earned Media Playbook for AI Citation:**

1. **Review Platform Saturation**
   - Maintain 50+ reviews on G2 (minimum threshold for category credibility)
   - Actively manage Capterra and TrustRadius profiles
   - Respond to every review (AI models note engagement signals)
   - Target specific category reports and quadrant placements
   - Ensure profile information is accurate, detailed, and uses positioning language from [Positioning & Messaging](./04-positioning-messaging.md)

2. **Media and Publication Strategy**
   - Identify 10-15 publications your ICP reads (from [Customer Research](./01-customer-research.md))
   - Develop proprietary data and original research that journalists want to cite
   - Build relationships with 5-10 journalists covering your category
   - Pitch data-driven stories, not product announcements
   - Contribute guest expert commentary on industry trends
   - Goal: 2-4 earned media mentions per quarter in Tier 1-2 sources

3. **Community Presence**
   - Identify communities where your ICP asks questions (Reddit, Slack groups, Discord, Stack Overflow)
   - Contribute genuinely helpful answers (not promotional)
   - AI models heavily index Reddit and community discussions
   - Ensure your brand is mentioned naturally in "what tool do you use for X?" threads
   - Never astroturf — AI models and communities both detect inauthenticity

4. **Comparison and Alternative Content (Third-Party)**
   - Encourage customers to write comparison posts on their own blogs
   - Ensure you appear on third-party "alternatives to [competitor]" pages
   - Reach out to sites that maintain comparison/alternative lists for your category
   - Provide accurate information to comparison sites proactively

5. **Expert and Thought Leader Amplification**
   - Identify 5-10 industry voices your ICP trusts
   - Provide them with early access, data, or partnership opportunities
   - Their independent endorsement carries enormous AI citation weight
   - Podcast guest appearances create transcripts AI models index

**Output:** `geo-earned-media-plan.md` — Prioritized list of target publications, communities, and review platforms with outreach calendar and pitch templates.

### Phase 4: Technical GEO Implementation (Day 9-10)

**Objective:** Configure technical infrastructure that helps AI models discover, crawl, and understand your content.

**Technical GEO Implementation Guide:**

**1. llms.txt File**

Create a file at `yoursite.com/llms.txt` that tells AI crawlers which pages are most valuable. This is the GEO equivalent of robots.txt — a direct signal to AI models about your most important content.

```
# [Your Company Name]

## About
[2-3 sentence description using positioning from Positioning & Messaging]

## Key Pages
- [Homepage](https://yoursite.com/) - Overview of [product] for [ICP]

```

**2. Schema Markup for AI Comprehension**

Implement structured data on every key page:

| Page Type | Schema Types | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Homepage | Organization, SoftwareApplication | Identity and category signals |
| Product pages | SoftwareApplication, Offer | Features, pricing, capabilities |
| Blog posts | Article, Author | Authority, recency, expertise |
| Comparison pages | Article, FAQ | Query matching, structured answers |
| Case studies | Article, Review | Social proof, outcome data |
| Documentation | TechArticle, HowTo | Technical authority |
| FAQ pages | FAQPage | Direct query-answer matching |
| Pricing | Offer, PriceSpecification | Commercial information accuracy |

**3. AI Crawler Access Configuration**

```
# robots.txt — DO NOT block AI crawlers

# Common AI crawlers to ALLOW:
# GPTBot (OpenAI/ChatGPT)
# Google-Extended (Gemini)
# PerplexityBot (Perplexity)
# ClaudeBot (Anthropic)
# Amazonbot (Alexa/Amazon)
# Bytespider (ByteDance)
# CCBot (Common Crawl — feeds many AI training sets)

# If you currently block any of these, UNBLOCK them:
User-agent: GPTBot
Allow: /

User-agent: Google-Extended
Allow: /

User-agent: PerplexityBot
Allow: /

User-agent: ClaudeBot
Allow: /

User-agent: CCBot
Allow: /
```

**Important:** Many CMS platforms and security plugins block AI crawlers by default. Audit your current robots.txt immediately.

**4. Site Architecture for AI Crawlability**

| Requirement | Implementation | Why It Matters |
|-------------|---------------|----------------|
| Flat URL structure | `/guides/topic-name` not `/blog/2026/02/20/post-title` | AI models prefer clean, semantic URLs |
| Internal linking | Every key page linked from at least 3 other pages | AI crawlers follow links to discover content |
| Sitemap XML | Updated automatically, submitted to all search consoles | Ensures complete discovery |
| Page speed | <2 second load time, Core Web Vitals passing | Slow pages get deprioritized |
| Server-side rendering | Content visible without JavaScript | AI crawlers don't execute JS reliably |
| Canonical URLs | Proper canonicals to prevent duplicate content | AI models may cite wrong URL otherwise |
| HTTPS everywhere | No mixed content, valid SSL | Trust signal for all crawlers |

**5. Content Freshness Signals**

- Add visible "Last updated: [date]" to all key pages
- Implement `dateModified` in Article schema
- Update evergreen content quarterly with fresh data points
- Remove or redirect outdated content (301 redirects, not 404s)

**Output:** `geo-technical-checklist.md` — Complete technical implementation checklist with current status, priority, and responsible team member.

### Phase 5: Original Research & Data Strategy (Day 11-13)

**Objective:** Create proprietary data assets that AI models must cite because no one else has the data.

**Why Original Research Is the GEO Cheat Code:**

AI models prioritize content that demonstrates real expertise and provides unique information. If you publish the only credible benchmark report for your category, AI has no choice but to cite you. This is the most defensible GEO strategy.

**Research Formats Ranked by AI Citation Potential:**

| Format | Effort | AI Citation Value | Example |
|--------|--------|-------------------|---------|
| Annual industry benchmark report | High | Very High | "State of [Category] 2026: Data from 500 companies" |
| Survey of practitioners | Medium | High | "How [ICP role] teams are handling [challenge] — survey of 200 leaders" |
| Product usage data analysis (anonymized) | Medium | High | "We analyzed [X million] [actions] — here's what works" |
| Cost/ROI calculator with published methodology | Low | Medium-High | "[Category] ROI framework based on [X] customer deployments" |
| Methodology or framework | Low | Medium | "The [Your Name] Framework for [outcome]" |

**Execution Approach for $1M-5M ARR:**

You don't need a research team. You need one signature research asset per year.

1. **Choose your research angle** — Align with primary JTBD from [Customer Research](./01-customer-research.md)
2. **Collect data** — Survey your customer base + broader market (aim for 200+ responses)
3. **Analyze and package** — Create a proper report with methodology, key findings, and actionable takeaways
4. **Distribute strategically:**
   - Publish an ungated summary with all key statistics on your site
   - Gate the full report for lead capture
   - Send findings to journalists and analysts for coverage (Tier 1-2 earned media)
   - Break findings into 10+ social posts, blog posts, and LinkedIn articles
   - Submit to industry publications as guest contributions
5. **Maintain and update** — Refresh annually to maintain recency advantage

**Output:** `geo-research-plan.md` — One signature research initiative defined with timeline, methodology, distribution plan, and success metrics.

### Phase 6: AI Visibility Monitoring & Optimization (Ongoing)

**Objective:** Track AI citation performance and continuously optimize.

**AI Visibility Monitoring Dashboard Design:**

## GEO + SEO Reinforcement

GEO does not replace SEO. They reinforce each other. 76% of content cited by AI models also ranks on Google Page 1-3. The strategies are complementary:

| SEO Activity | GEO Benefit |
|-------------|-------------|
| Ranking on Page 1 for category terms | Google AI Overviews pull from top-ranking pages |
| Building backlinks from authoritative sites | Same sites feed AI training data and citation graphs |
| Publishing comprehensive, well-structured content | AI models prefer the same content quality signals |
| Earning featured snippets | Featured snippet content is prioritized for AI Overviews |
| Technical site health (speed, crawlability, schema) | AI crawlers benefit from the same infrastructure |

| GEO Activity | SEO Benefit |
|-------------|-------------|
| Earning media mentions for AI citation | Media mentions = high-authority backlinks |
| Publishing original research | Research gets linked to = organic backlinks |
| Optimizing content structure (headers, lists, fact density) | Better structured content ranks better organically |
| Building community presence (Reddit, forums) | Forum content links back to your site |
| Maintaining review platform presence | Review sites link to your domain |

**The Compounding Effect:** Every piece of GEO work strengthens your SEO, and every piece of SEO work strengthens your GEO. Build both simultaneously through the [Content Engine](./08-content-engine.md).

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- **Don't treat GEO as a separate channel from SEO.** They share 76% of the same source material. Run them as one integrated program through your [Content Engine](./08-content-engine.md), not as competing initiatives.
- **Don't optimize only your own website.** AI models weight third-party sources more heavily than your own content. If you spend 80% of GEO effort on your site and 20% on earned media, invert that ratio.
- **Don't block AI crawlers.** Some companies reflexively block GPTBot and other AI crawlers. If you want to be cited by AI, you need to be crawled by AI. Check your robots.txt today.
- **Don't stuff content with keywords.** AI models understand semantics, not keyword density. Write for comprehensiveness and clarity, not keyword repetition. This isn't 2012 SEO.
- **Don't ignore accuracy.** If AI models are saying something wrong about you, fixing it is urgent. Inaccurate AI citations spread and compound — they get absorbed into training data and become harder to correct over time.
- **Don't skip monitoring.** You cannot manage what you don't measure. AI results change constantly. Monthly monitoring is the minimum.
- **Don't create thin content to cover more queries.** AI models reward depth over breadth. One definitive 2,500-word guide outperforms ten 500-word blog posts.
- **Don't ignore community discussions.** Reddit and niche communities are heavily indexed by AI models, especially Perplexity. A single highly-upvoted Reddit thread recommending your product can outperform months of on-site SEO.
- **Don't pay for fake reviews or astroturf communities.** AI models are trained to detect inauthentic content, and platforms actively penalize it. Earn mentions honestly.
- **Don't wait.** This is the land-grab phase. Every month you delay, competitors are building AI citation equity that compounds. Start with the audit (Phase 1) this week.
