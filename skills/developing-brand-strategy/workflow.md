## Purpose

Brand is not your logo. Brand is the residue of every interaction a buyer has with your company — and at $1M-5M ARR, it is the single most underinvested asset relative to its impact. When 41% of B2B buyers already have a vendor in mind before they start their buying process, brand IS your cheapest acquisition channel. It bypasses paid bidding wars, it bypasses AI answer layers, and it compounds over time while paid spend decays the moment you stop writing checks. This skill builds the strategic brand decisions — narrative, voice, thought leadership, community presence, earned media — that drive lower CAC and shorter sales cycles.

---

## Business Context ($1M-5M ARR)

- You have product-market fit and a small but growing customer base — enough to have a story worth telling
- Most of your brand "strategy" is accidental: whatever the founders have posted on LinkedIn and whatever your website says
- Competitors at your stage are also underinvesting in brand, which makes early investment a disproportionate advantage
- Your buyers are researching in dark social — Slack communities, Reddit threads, peer DMs — where paid spend cannot reach
- AI search engines (ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini) are forming opinions about your category and your brand right now, whether you shape it or not
- Founder-led content is your unfair advantage at this stage — no enterprise company can replicate founder authenticity
- Every dollar of brand investment compounds: a thought leadership piece continues generating branded search for years, while a paid ad stops the second you pause the campaign

---

## Workflow

### Phase 1: Brand Audit & Baseline (Day 1-2)

**Objective:** Measure where your brand stands today so you can track compound growth.

**Inputs required:**
- [Customer Voice Library](./01-customer-research.md) — how customers describe you in their own words
- [ICP Definition](./02-icp-definition.md) — which communities and audiences to prioritize
- [Competitive Intel](./03-competitive-intel.md) — how competitors are positioned in the market narrative
- [Positioning & Messaging](./04-positioning-messaging.md) — your strategic positioning and core messaging
- Current content inventory (blog posts, podcasts, videos, social posts, guest appearances)
- Google Search Console data (branded search queries and volume)
- Social media analytics (LinkedIn, Twitter/X follower counts, engagement rates)
- Mentions data (Google Alerts, social listening, Reddit, community mentions)
- Review site presence (G2, Capterra, TrustRadius — review count, ratings, share of voice)
- AI search results (query your category in ChatGPT, Perplexity, Gemini — document what they say about you)

**AI Workflow:**
1. Aggregate all brand touchpoint data into a single audit corpus
2. Use AI to analyze and score across five dimensions:
   - **Brand awareness** — branded search volume, direct traffic, social following, review site presence
   - **Brand perception** — sentiment analysis across reviews, social mentions, community discussions
   - **Brand consistency** — how uniform is voice, message, and visual presentation across touchpoints
   - **Share of voice** — your mention volume vs. competitors in your category
   - **AI brand presence** — what AI search engines say when asked about your category, your product, your competitors
3. Identify the largest gaps between current brand state and competitive landscape
4. Generate a brand baseline scorecard

**Output:** `brand-audit-baseline.md` — Quantified brand baseline with scores per dimension, competitive comparison, and prioritized gap analysis.

### Phase 2: Brand Narrative Architecture (Day 3-5)

**Objective:** Build the foundational story your brand tells — why you exist, why it matters, why now.

**Narrative Framework:**

A brand narrative is not a tagline. It is the strategic story that connects your company's existence to a shift in the world that your ICP cares about. Every piece of content, every sales call, every community interaction should be a fragment of this narrative.

```
Brand Narrative Architecture:

1. THE SHIFT (What's changing in the world)
   - What macro or industry trend is making the old way untenable?
   - Why can't your ICP keep doing what they've been doing?
   - What's the cost of inaction?
   Source: Customer Research trigger events + Competitive Intel market trends

2. THE BROKEN STATUS QUO (What's wrong with current solutions)
   - What do existing solutions get wrong?
   - What compromises do buyers currently accept?
   - What do your churned-from-competitor customers say?
   Source: Customer Research pain points + Competitive Intel gaps

3. THE BELIEF (Your company's point of view)
   - What do you believe about solving this problem that others don't?
   - This is your contrarian or differentiated worldview
   - It should be specific enough to disagree with
   Source: Positioning & Messaging strategic narrative

4. THE PROOF (Evidence your belief is right)
   - Customer outcomes that demonstrate your approach works
   - Data points, case studies, before/after transformations
   - Third-party validation (analyst mentions, awards, review ratings)
   Source: Customer Research value realized + case study data

5. THE FUTURE (Where this leads)
   - What does the world look like if your approach wins?
   - What becomes possible for your customers?
   - This is the aspirational pull that makes people want to be part of your story
   Source: Product vision + customer aspiration data
```

**AI Workflow:**
1. Feed positioning, customer research, and competitive intel into the narrative framework
2. Generate 3 narrative variants — each emphasizing a different "shift" angle
3. Pressure-test each variant against ICP priorities and competitive differentiation
4. Select and refine the strongest narrative
5. Distill into three formats:
   - **Full narrative** (500-word version for internal alignment)
   - **Elevator narrative** (60-second version for founder conversations)
   - **One-liner** (single sentence that encapsulates the belief)

**Output:** `brand-narrative.md` — The canonical brand story in all three formats, with supporting evidence mapped to each narrative element.

### Phase 3: Thought Leadership Strategy (Day 6-8)

**Objective:** Define who says what, where, and how often — the people and perspectives that make your brand tangible.

**Thought Leadership Model Selection:**

At $1M-5M ARR, you have three thought leadership vectors. Most companies should run 1-2, not all three.

| Model | Best When | Investment | Payoff Timeline |
|-------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Founder-Led** | Founder has strong opinions and enjoys content creation | 3-5 hrs/week of founder time | 3-6 months to traction |
| **Practitioner-Led** | You have subject-matter experts on staff willing to share | 2-4 hrs/week per practitioner | 4-8 months to traction |
| **Company-Led** | Neither founder nor practitioners want to be public | Full content team investment | 6-12 months to traction |

**Founder-Led Strategy (Recommended Default at This Stage):**

```
Why founder-led wins at $1M-5M ARR:
- People trust people, not logos
- Founders have authentic credibility from building the product
- Algorithm-friendly: personal accounts get 5-10x the reach of company pages
- No enterprise competitor can replicate founder authenticity
- Creates a moat — the founder becomes synonymous with the category POV

Founder Content Cadence:
- LinkedIn: 3-5 posts/week (mix of insight, story, and opinion)
- Long-form: 2 essays/month (publish on blog, repurpose to LinkedIn)
- Podcast guest: 2-4 appearances/quarter on ICP-relevant shows
- Community participation: 30 min/day in 2-3 key communities
- Conference speaking: 1-2 talks/quarter at ICP-relevant events

Content Pillars (tied to Brand Narrative):
1. [The Shift] — Content about the industry change driving urgency
2. [The Belief] — Contrarian takes on how the problem should be solved
3. [The Proof] — Customer stories and data that validate the approach
4. [The Practice] — Tactical how-to content that demonstrates expertise
5. [The Culture] — Behind-the-scenes of building the company (recruiting magnet)
```

**Topic Authority Mapping:**

```
For each content pillar, define:
- Core topics: What you MUST own in your category (3-5 per pillar)
- Adjacent topics: Related areas that expand your reach (2-3 per pillar)
- Avoid topics: What's off-brand or off-ICP (explicit exclusion list)

Map against:
- ICP's top information sources (from Customer Research)
- Competitor content gaps (from Competitive Intel)
- AI search training signals (what topics does AI associate with your category?)
```

**Output:** `thought-leadership-strategy.md` — Model selection, content pillars, topic authority map, cadence plan, and success metrics per pillar.

### Phase 4: Brand Voice & Editorial Guidelines (Day 9-10)

**Objective:** Codify how your brand sounds so every touchpoint reinforces the same identity — even when 10 different people are creating content.

**Brand Voice Framework:**

```
Voice Definition Template:

VOICE ATTRIBUTES (pick 3-4, define each with a spectrum):
1. [Attribute]: We are __________, not __________
   Example: "We are direct, not aggressive"
   Example: "We are technical, not jargon-heavy"
   Example: "We are confident, not arrogant"
   Example: "We are warm, not corporate"

TONE MODULATION (voice stays constant, tone shifts by context):
| Context | Tone Shift | Example |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Marketing site | Confident, aspirational | "Ship faster without the chaos" |
| Blog/thought leadership | Authoritative, generous | "Here's what we learned scaling to..." |
| Support/docs | Clear, patient, precise | "To configure X, follow these steps" |
| Social media | Conversational, opinionated | "Hot take: most teams over-complicate..." |
| Sales materials | Consultative, evidence-driven | "Companies like yours typically see..." |
| Error messages | Human, helpful, non-blaming | "Something went wrong. Here's how to fix it" |
| Recruiting | Ambitious, authentic | "We're solving hard problems with a small team" |

LANGUAGE RULES:
- Words we use: [list from Customer Voice Library — mirror their language]
- Words we never use: [corporate jargon to avoid, competitor terminology, etc.]
- Sentence structure: [short sentences preferred, active voice, no hedging]
- Formatting conventions: [how we use bold, bullets, headers, emoji policy]
- Technical depth: [assume reader knows X, explain Y, never patronize about Z]
```

**AI Workflow:**
1. Analyze top-performing content (by engagement, shares, conversion) for voice patterns
2. Analyze Customer Voice Library for language that resonates
3. Analyze competitor content to identify voice differentiation opportunities
4. Generate draft voice guidelines with examples for each context
5. Test guidelines by having AI rewrite 5 existing pieces in the new voice — review for consistency

**Output:** `brand-voice-guidelines.md` — Voice attributes, tone modulation guide, language rules, and before/after examples for each content context.

### Phase 5: Community & Earned Media Strategy (Day 11-14)

**Objective:** Define where your brand shows up organically — communities, earned media, events — and the strategy for each.

**Community Positioning Map:**

```
Community Audit Framework:

For each potential community, evaluate:
1. ICP Density: What % of members match your ICP? (from ICP Definition)
2. Activity Level: How active is the community? (posts/day, engagement)
3. Commercial Tolerance: Does the community allow vendor participation?
4. Competitor Presence: Are competitors already active here?
5. Influence Reach: Do conversations here spread to other channels?

Priority Score = (ICP Density × 3) + (Activity × 2) + (Commercial Tolerance × 2)
                 + (Low Competitor Presence × 1.5) + (Influence Reach × 1.5)
```

**Community Strategy by Channel:**

| Channel | Strategy | Time Investment | Do's | Don'ts |
|---------|----------|-----------------|------|--------|
| **Slack communities** | Help first, pitch never. Be the most useful person in the room | 30 min/day | Answer questions, share frameworks, link to helpful (non-sales) content | Drop product links, pitch in DMs, only show up to promote |
| **Reddit** (r/SaaS, niche subs) | Participate authentically. Disclose affiliation. Add value | 20 min/day | Share genuine experience, upvote others, participate in threads | Astroturf, create fake reviews, post thinly-veiled ads |
| **LinkedIn** | Founder/practitioner personal brands. Comment strategy | 30 min/day | Comment thoughtfully on ICP-relevant posts, build genuine relationships | Use engagement pods, auto-comment, only post self-promotion |
| **Discord servers** | Niche communities where your ICP hangs out | 20 min/day | Join conversations naturally, share expertise | Spam multiple servers with the same message |
| **Twitter/X** | Category conversation and hot takes | 20 min/day | Engage with industry debates, quote-tweet with added perspective | Tweet only about your product, use thread bots |

**Earned Media Strategy:**

```
Earned Media Channels (prioritized for $1M-5M ARR):

1. PODCAST GUESTING (highest ROI at this stage)
   - Target: 2-4 appearances/quarter
   - Targeting criteria: Shows your ICP actually listens to (ask in Customer Research)
   - Pitch angle: Tie to brand narrative "shift" — not a product pitch
   - Outreach: Warm intros > cold pitches. Build relationships with hosts first
   - Repurpose: Clip for social, transcribe for blog, extract quotes for case studies

2. GUEST POSTS & BYLINES
   - Target: 1-2/quarter in ICP-relevant publications
   - Publication targeting: Industry blogs, SaaS media, niche newsletters
   - Angle: Lead with the contrarian belief from your brand narrative
   - SEO bonus: Backlinks from authoritative domains boost GEO signals

3. PR / PRESS
   - At $1M-5M ARR, traditional PR agencies are rarely worth the cost
   - Instead: Build relationships with 5-10 journalists who cover your space
   - Newsjacking: Have pre-written commentary ready for industry news events
   - Data stories: Original research or benchmarks from your product data

4. CONFERENCE & EVENT SPEAKING
   - Target: 1-2 talks/quarter at ICP-relevant events
   - Start with smaller niche events (higher acceptance rate, more engaged audience)
   - Submit talk proposals tied to brand narrative, not product demos
   - Repurpose: Record for content, write up key takeaways for blog

5. COMMUNITY-DRIVEN CONTENT
   - Host AMAs in relevant Slack communities or subreddits
   - Run small, high-quality virtual events (workshops, roundtables)
   - Create and share original research or benchmarks (category-level, not product-level)
```

**Dark Social Strategy:**

Dark social — the unmeasurable conversations happening in DMs, private Slack channels, text threads, and in-person conversations — drives a significant portion of B2B buying decisions. You cannot track it, but you can fuel it.

```
Fueling Dark Social:

1. Create content worth sharing privately
   - Contrarian insights that make people say "you need to read this"
   - Specific, tactical frameworks people screenshot and send to colleagues
   - Data or benchmarks people reference in internal meetings

2. Make sharing frictionless
   - Key stats as standalone images (easy to paste in Slack)
   - TL;DR summaries at the top of long pieces
   - Quotable one-liners that are easy to text to a peer

3. Track dark social proxies
   - "How did you hear about us?" open text field on every form
   - Direct traffic spikes correlated with content publish dates
   - Branded search volume trends
   - Self-reported attribution in sales calls
```

**Output:** `community-earned-media-strategy.md` — Prioritized community list with strategy per channel, earned media plan with targets and pitch angles, and dark social playbook.

### Phase 6: Brand in the AI Era (Day 15-16)

**Objective:** Ensure your brand is accurately represented and favorably positioned in AI-generated answers — because AI search engines are rapidly becoming the first touchpoint for B2B research.

**AI Brand Audit:**

```
Query your category in every major AI search tool and document results:

Queries to test:
1. "What is the best [your category] tool?"
2. "Compare [your product] vs [competitor]"
3. "[Your category] for [your ICP description]"
4. "Alternatives to [top competitor]"
5. "[Your product] reviews"
6. "How to solve [your ICP's primary JTBD]"

For each query, document:
- Are you mentioned? In what position?
- What is said about you? Is it accurate?
- What sources does the AI cite?
- How are competitors described?
- What narrative does the AI construct about your category?
```

**AI Brand Strategy:**

| Signal Type | What AI Models Learn From | Action |
|-------------|--------------------------|--------|
| **Authoritative content** | Blog posts, documentation, guides on your domain | Publish comprehensive, well-structured content that AI can cite |
| **Third-party validation** | Reviews, analyst mentions, press coverage | Increase review volume on G2/Capterra, pursue analyst briefings |
| **Structured data** | Schema markup, clear product descriptions | Ensure website uses proper structured data and clear category language |
| **Backlinks & citations** | Other sites linking to and referencing your content | Guest posts, earned media, community content that links back |
| **Consistent entity identity** | Same product name, description, category across all sources | Audit and standardize how your brand is described everywhere |
| **Recency signals** | Fresh content indicates active, relevant brand | Maintain consistent publishing cadence — don't go dark |

**Output:** `ai-brand-strategy.md` — AI audit results, gap analysis, and action plan to influence AI-generated brand representation. Feeds directly into [GEO Optimizer](./09-geo-optimizer.md).

### Phase 7: Employer Brand (Day 17)

**Objective:** At $1M-5M ARR, recruiting is a constant bottleneck. Your employer brand is a byproduct of your market brand — align them intentionally.

**Employer Brand Framework:**

```
Employer Brand ≠ Separate Brand

At this stage, your employer brand is your market brand viewed through a
recruiting lens. The same narrative, voice, and thought leadership that
attract customers should attract talent.

Key Employer Brand Channels:
1. Founder LinkedIn content (include "building" content pillar — 20% of posts)
2. Team member social presence (encourage, don't mandate)
3. "How we work" content (blog posts about engineering, design, culture decisions)
4. Job descriptions written in brand voice (not generic HR-speak)
5. Glassdoor/LinkedIn company page maintenance
6. Open source contributions or public tools (for technical roles)

Employer Brand Metrics:
- Inbound application rate (vs. outbound recruiting effort)
- Candidate source attribution ("how did you hear about us?")
- Offer acceptance rate
- Time-to-fill for key roles
- Glassdoor rating trend
```

**Output:** `employer-brand-plan.md` — Employer brand strategy aligned to market brand, with channel plan and metrics.

### Phase 8: Brand Measurement Framework (Day 18-19)

**Objective:** Brand is hard to measure, but not impossible. Build a measurement system that tracks the compound effect of brand investment over time.

**Brand Measurement Dashboard:**

| Metric | Measurement Method | Baseline | Monthly Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| **Branded search volume** | Google Search Console, SEMrush | Set in audit | 10-15% MoM growth | Direct signal of brand awareness. Branded search has highest conversion rate and lowest CAC |
| **Direct traffic** | Google Analytics | Set in audit | 5-10% MoM growth | People typing your URL = brand recall |
| **Share of voice** | Social listening tools, manual tracking | Set in audit | Increasing vs. competitors | Relative brand strength in your category |
| **Unaided recall proxy** | "How did you hear about us?" open text | Set in audit | Increasing % of "word of mouth" and brand-name mentions | Closest proxy to unaided recall without expensive research |
| **Social engagement rate** | Likes, comments, shares / impressions | Set in audit | Engagement rate > 2% (LinkedIn) | Quality of brand resonance, not just reach |
| **Earned media placements** | Manual tracking | Set in audit | 3-5 placements/quarter | Third-party validation volume |
| **Review volume & rating** | G2, Capterra, TrustRadius | Set in audit | Net new reviews/quarter, rating > 4.3 | Social proof and AI training signal |
| **AI search presence** | Quarterly AI audit (Phase 6) | Set in audit | Mentioned in 50%+ of category queries | Future-proofing brand for AI-first discovery |
| **Community mention volume** | Manual tracking, social listening | Set in audit | Increasing quarter-over-quarter | Organic word-of-mouth indicator |
| **Founder content reach** | LinkedIn analytics, podcast downloads | Set in audit | Growing month-over-month | Thought leadership penetration |

**The Compound Effect Tracker:**

```
Track these ratios quarterly to prove brand investment is compounding:

1. Branded vs. Non-Branded Traffic Ratio
   - Healthy: Branded traffic growing as % of total over time
   - Unhealthy: 100% of traffic from paid/organic non-branded

2. CAC Trend for Brand-Influenced Deals
   - Tag deals where buyer mentioned brand awareness in attribution
   - Track CAC for brand-influenced vs. non-brand-influenced
   - Over time, brand-influenced CAC should be 30-50% lower

3. Sales Cycle Length for Brand-Aware Buyers
   - Segment deals by whether buyer knew your brand before outreach
   - Brand-aware buyers should close 20-40% faster

4. Paid Efficiency Ratio
   - As brand grows, paid CAC should decrease (brand lifts all channels)
   - Track paid CAC trend alongside brand investment trend

5. Inbound Quality Score
   - As brand strengthens, inbound leads should be higher-ICP match rate
   - Track ICP match % of inbound leads over time
```

**Output:** `brand-measurement-dashboard.md` — Full measurement framework with data sources, baselines, targets, and compound effect tracking methodology.

## Key Metrics

| Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Branded search volume MoM growth | 10-15% | Most reliable signal of brand awareness growth |
| Share of voice vs. top 3 competitors | Increasing quarterly | Relative competitive brand strength |
| CAC for brand-influenced deals vs. overall | 30-50% lower | Proves brand is a CAC weapon |
| Sales cycle for brand-aware buyers | 20-40% shorter | Proves brand accelerates pipeline |
| Founder content engagement rate | >2% on LinkedIn | Thought leadership resonance |
| Earned media placements | 3-5/quarter | Third-party validation volume |
| AI search mentions in category queries | Present in 50%+ | Future-proofs brand for AI-first discovery |
| "How did you hear about us?" brand/WOM | Increasing % quarterly | Organic awareness and dark social proxy |

---

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

- **Don't confuse brand strategy with visual identity.** A new logo won't lower your CAC. A new narrative might. This skill is about strategic brand decisions, not design exercises.
- **Don't wait until you "can afford" brand investment.** Brand compounds, so the best time to start was yesterday. At $1M-5M ARR you can build brand with founder time, not big budgets.
- **Don't build a "company voice" that sounds like everyone else.** If your brand voice could be swapped onto a competitor's site without anyone noticing, it's not a brand voice — it's a template.
- **Don't separate thought leadership from demand gen.** Every piece of thought leadership should connect back to the brand narrative, which connects to the problem you solve, which connects to demand. Brand and demand are not opposing strategies.
- **Don't outsource founder-led content to ghostwriters on day one.** The founder's authentic voice is the asset. A ghostwriter can help scale it later, but the founder must establish the authentic voice first.
- **Don't pitch in communities.** The fastest way to destroy brand equity in a community is to show up and sell. Help first. Build reputation. Let people discover what you do.
- **Don't ignore AI search.** If AI tools are describing your category without mentioning you, you have a brand problem that content marketing alone won't fix. It requires structured, multi-channel brand presence.
- **Don't measure brand only with lagging indicators.** Branded search, direct traffic, and share of voice are leading indicators. Revenue impact is a lagging indicator. Track both, but don't kill brand investment because revenue attribution is hard.
