# Brand Strategy

## Overview

Brand is the residue of every buyer interaction, and at $1M-5M ARR it is the most underinvested asset relative to impact. When 41% of B2B buyers already have a vendor in mind before buying, brand becomes your cheapest acquisition channel -- it compounds over time while paid spend decays the moment you stop writing checks.

## When to Use

- Brand "strategy" is whatever the founders happened to post and whatever the website says
- Brand voice could be swapped onto a competitor's site without anyone noticing
- Buyers researching in dark social where paid spend cannot reach
- AI search engines return inaccurate or no information about your product
- CAC is rising without organic/brand-driven pipeline sources
- Preparing to scale content, launch a product, or enter a new segment
- Founder-led content lacks strategic framework connecting to pipeline

**Don't use when:** You have a validated brand narrative, voice guidelines, and measurement framework less than 6 months old with no major positioning shifts.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Brand audit & baseline | Day 1-2 | Brand scorecard |
| Brand narrative architecture | Day 3-5 | Brand story in 3 formats |
| Thought leadership strategy | Day 6-8 | Content pillars, cadence |
| Brand voice & editorial | Day 9-10 | Voice attributes, tone guide |
| Community & earned media | Day 11-14 | Channel priorities, media plan |
| Brand in the AI era | Day 15-16 | AI audit, action plan |
| Employer brand | Day 17 | Employer brand plan |
| Brand measurement | Day 18-19 | Compound effect dashboard |

## Core Deliverables

- **Brand Audit Baseline** -- Scored across awareness, perception, consistency, share of voice, AI presence
- **Brand Narrative** -- Full, elevator, and one-liner formats
- **Thought Leadership Strategy** -- Model selection, content pillars, topic authority map
- **Brand Voice Guidelines** -- Voice attributes, tone per context, language rules
- **Community & Earned Media Plan** -- Prioritized communities, podcast targets, dark social playbook
- **AI Brand Strategy** -- AI search audit and action plan

## Common Mistakes

- Confusing brand strategy with visual identity (a new logo will not lower CAC)
- Waiting until you "can afford" brand investment (brand compounds, start early)
- Outsourcing founder content to ghostwriters before establishing authentic voice
- Pitching in communities instead of helping first
- Separating thought leadership from demand generation
- Ignoring AI search when AI tools are already describing your category without you
