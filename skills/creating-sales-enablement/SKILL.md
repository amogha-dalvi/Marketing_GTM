description: Use when sales reps lack deal-stage-specific content, when the founder's sales knowledge lives in their head instead of a system, when win rates are declining or sales cycles are lengthening, when no buying group content map exists, or when reps spend significant time creating content that should already exist. Use when sales and marketing lack shared definitions and feedback loops.

# Sales Enablement

## Overview

Sales enablement turns upstream marketing strategy into deal-ready ammunition reps can access when they need it. At $1M-5M ARR with no dedicated PMM, enablement must be systematized, AI-assisted, and prioritized around what shortens sales cycles and improves win rates.

## When to Use

- Reps waste time searching for or creating content that should exist
- Founder's sales knowledge is not captured in a reusable system
- Win rates are declining or deals stall at specific stages
- No persona-specific assets exist for the buying group
- Sales and marketing lack shared definitions, SLAs, or feedback loops
- Competitive battlecards are outdated or nonexistent
- No signal-based engagement system for intent-triggered outreach

**Don't use when:** Upstream positioning, messaging, and competitive intel are not yet built.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Enablement audit and prioritization | Day 1-2 | Gap analysis and tiered build plan |
| Buying group orchestration | Day 3-4 | Role-by-role asset requirements map |
| AI-assisted asset creation | Week 1-3 | Complete Tier 1-2 asset library |
| Signal-based engagement system | Week 2-3 | Intent signals, routing rules, response templates |
| Sales-marketing alignment | Week 3-4 | Shared definitions, SLAs, feedback cadences |
| Enablement rollout and adoption | Week 4 | Training, distribution, adoption tracking |

## Core Deliverables

- **Asset Priority Matrix** -- Tiered build order by win-rate impact, need frequency, and gap severity
- **Buying Group Content Map** -- Assets per stakeholder role (champion, economic buyer, technical buyer, end user, blocker)
- **Enablement Asset Library** -- Battlecards, sales deck, objection guides, case studies, ROI calculator, email sequences
- **Signal-Based Engagement Playbook** -- Intent detection, speed-to-lead targets, AI-personalized responses
- **Sales-Marketing Alignment System** -- Shared definitions, sync cadences, quarterly audit

## Common Mistakes

- Building assets nobody asked for instead of following the priority matrix
- Creating one sales deck for all personas instead of persona-specific versions
- Gating enablement behind a system reps do not use
- Skipping the weekly sales-marketing feedback loop
- Treating AI output as final without human review for real stories and metrics
- Measuring by asset volume instead of usage rate and win-rate impact
- Letting stale content persist beyond 90 days without refresh or archive

## Integration

**Feeds into:** reducing-cac, accelerating-pipeline, growing-nrr, tracking-marketing-metrics

**Refresh:** Battlecards within 48 hours of competitive changes. Objection guides monthly. Case studies quarterly. Sales deck quarterly. Full enablement audit quarterly aligned with sales QBR.
