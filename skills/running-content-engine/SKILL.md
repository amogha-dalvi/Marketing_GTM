description: Use when the team needs a systematic content production workflow, when content output is ad hoc or inconsistent, when existing content lacks a distribution plan, when BOFU conversion content is missing, or when a single content person needs to maximize output with AI assistance. Use when content exists but has no measurement or repurposing system.

# Content Engine

## Overview

The content engine turns positioning, messaging, and customer insight into published assets that generate pipeline. At $1M-5M ARR, content compounds only when operated as a system with prioritization, AI-assisted production, distribution checklists, and performance measurement.

## When to Use

- Content production is ad hoc with no editorial calendar or backlog
- Team publishes mostly TOFU blog posts but lacks BOFU conversion content
- Content exists but has no distribution plan or repurposing workflow
- A single content person needs to produce at scale with AI assistance
- No measurement system exists to tier and optimize existing content
- Sales team cannot find or use marketing content in deals
- Founder knowledge is not being captured as content

**Don't use when:** You have no upstream positioning, messaging, or customer research to base content on. Build those first.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Strategy foundation | Day 1-2 | Funnel allocation, channel map, editorial themes |
| Prioritization and scoring | Day 3 | Scored backlog of 30-50 pieces |
| AI-assisted production | Ongoing | 15-25 pieces/month via 7-stage pipeline |
| Repurposing engine | Per piece | 10+ format variants per core asset |
| Founder content | Ongoing | 4-6 authentic voice pieces/month |
| Editorial calendar | Ongoing | Monthly calendar with weekly theme cadence |
| Performance measurement | Monthly | Tiered library with optimization actions |

## Core Deliverables

- **Content Strategy** -- Funnel allocation (50% BOFU, 35% MOFU, 15% TOFU) and channel-content fit map
- **Scored Content Backlog** -- 30-50 pieces prioritized by intent, ICP relevance, competitive gap
- **AI Production Pipeline** -- 7-stage workflow (brief, draft, enrich, edit, optimize, distribute, measure)
- **Repurposing Framework** -- 1-to-10 system per core asset
- **Editorial Calendar** -- Monthly structure with BOFU, MOFU, founder, and research weeks
- **Performance Tier System** -- 90-day tiering with actions per tier

## Common Mistakes

- Inverting funnel allocation (80% TOFU instead of 50% BOFU)
- Publishing without a distribution checklist completed before go-live
- Using AI for volume without quality control checkpoints
- Gating generic content behind forms instead of ungating value
- Ignoring content decay and letting stale pieces erode authority
- Creating content without a proprietary angle (original data, customer quote, unique framework)
- Separating content from sales instead of building with a "sales can send this" lens

## Integration

**Feeds into:** optimizing-geo-visibility, creating-sales-enablement, executing-launch-playbook, reducing-cac, accelerating-pipeline, growing-nrr

**Refresh:** Strategy quarterly. Backlog and performance monthly. Full library audit every 6 months.
