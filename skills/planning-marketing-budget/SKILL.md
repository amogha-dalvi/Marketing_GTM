description: Use when the user needs to derive a marketing budget from revenue targets, plan headcount for a 1-3 person team, decide what to build vs. buy vs. automate, or allocate spend across channels with ROI expectations. Use when budget is based on gut feel rather than revenue math, or resource allocation feels arbitrary.

# Marketing Budget & Resource Allocation

## Overview

At $1M-5M ARR you are resource-constrained by definition. This skill turns revenue targets into a precise resource plan -- how much to spend, where to spend it, who does the work, and what tools to buy. Every downstream execution skill draws its resource envelope from this one.

## When to Use

- Marketing budget is set by gut feel or arbitrary percentage rather than revenue-backward math
- No clear headcount plan exists (unclear when to hire marketer #2 or #3)
- Tool stack is growing without ROI justification or quarterly audits
- Channel spend is spread too thin across 6+ channels with no clear winner
- Founder time on marketing is untracked and unoptimized
- Preparing for a new fiscal year, funding round, or growth target change
- AI tools have changed the resource equation but team has not recalibrated

**Don't use when:** You have a validated revenue-backward budget model less than one quarter old with monthly review cadence already in place.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Revenue-backward budget model | Day 1 | Budget derived from revenue targets |
| Headcount planning | Day 2 | Hiring roadmap with timing triggers |
| Build vs. buy vs. automate | Day 3 | Decision matrix per marketing function |
| Tool & tech stack budgeting | Day 4 | Tiered tool list with cost justification |
| Channel ROI estimation & phasing | Day 5 | Channel allocation, quarterly sequencing |
| Monthly budget review process | Ongoing | Review framework with decision rules |

## Core Deliverables

- **Revenue-Backward Budget Model** -- Total budget from pipeline targets, allocated by category
- **Headcount Plan** -- Hiring triggers, role profiles, outsource-vs-hire decisions
- **Build/Buy/Automate Matrix** -- Strategic value x frequency x AI-automatable scoring
- **Tech Stack Budget** -- Tier 1/2/3 tool selections with cost and alternatives
- **Channel ROI Model** -- Spend, time-to-result, pipeline-per-dollar per channel
- **Monthly Review Template** -- Agenda, decision rules, reallocation triggers

## Common Mistakes

- Allocating budget by gut feel instead of working backward from revenue targets
- Spreading budget across 6+ channels (master 1-2 before adding a third)
- Hiring ahead of playbook (prove it with freelancers and AI first)
- Buying Tier 3 tools at $2M ARR when a spreadsheet works fine
- Treating founder time as free without tracking opportunity cost
- Locking into annual contracts before a channel is proven
- Setting budget once a year without monthly reviews

## Integration

**Feeds into:** running-content-engine, optimizing-geo-visibility, creating-sales-enablement, executing-launch-playbook, reducing-cac, accelerating-pipeline, managing-marketing-ops

**Refresh:** Full budget rebuild annually. Monthly review with channel ROI assessment. Headcount and tech stack audit quarterly. Build/buy/automate reassessment every 6 months.
