description: Use when launching a new product, feature, or market entry and needing a structured execution plan. Use when launches lack cross-functional coordination, asset creation is bottlenecked, internal enablement is being skipped, or launch timelines are stretching beyond reasonable windows. Use when needing to classify launch tier and compress cycles with AI.

# Launch Playbook

## Overview

A launch is the highest-leverage marketing event because attention is time-bounded. This skill provides a repeatable, tier-based system to compress launch cycles from months to days using AI, without sacrificing quality or cross-functional alignment.

## When to Use

- Launching a new product, pricing model, or entering a new market
- Shipping a major feature or integration that expands the value prop
- Minor feature updates that still need coordinated communication
- Launch cycles are taking too long (months instead of weeks)
- Internal teams are caught off-guard by launches (sales, CS not briefed)
- Asset creation is bottlenecked or inconsistent across launches
- No repeatable launch process exists
- A competitor launched something that requires a response

**Don't use when:** The change is purely internal with no customer-facing impact, or when a changelog entry alone is sufficient.

## Quick Reference

| Phase | Duration | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| Launch tier classification | Day 0 | Launch brief with tier and owners |
| Positioning and messaging | Day 1-5 | Messaging matrix, headlines |
| Asset creation | Day 3-12 | 3-25 assets per tier |
| Internal enablement | Day 5-14 | Sales, CS, exec briefings |
| Launch execution | Day 0 + 48 hours | Multi-channel go-live |
| Channel plan execution | Day 0-7 | Channel activation |
| Post-launch optimization | Day 2-30 | Performance data |
| Launch retrospective | Day 14-30 | Retrospective doc |

## Core Deliverables

- **Launch Brief** -- Tier classification, business case, success metrics, timeline
- **Launch Messaging Doc** -- Positioning statement, messaging matrix, persona angles
- **Launch Asset Package** -- Channel assets from messaging foundation (3-25 per tier)
- **Internal Enablement Kit** -- Sales one-pager, talk tracks, FAQ, CS briefing
- **Launch Day Runsheet** -- Execution plan with owners and escalation paths
- **Launch Retrospective** -- Results vs. targets, channel ROI, action items

## Common Mistakes

- Treating every launch as Tier 1 (creates launch fatigue)
- Skipping internal enablement (sales saying "I don't know" on launch day)
- Building assets before messaging is finalized (guarantees rewrites)
- Launching on a Friday (wastes critical first 48 hours on a weekend)
- No measurement plan before launch day
- Skipping the retrospective (repeats same mistakes next launch)

## Integration

**Feeds into:** reducing-cac, accelerating-pipeline, tracking-marketing-metrics

**Refresh:** Process review quarterly. Tier thresholds every 6 months. Retrospective after every Tier 1 and Tier 2 launch.
