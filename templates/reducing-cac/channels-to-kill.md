## Dying Tactics Reference

These tactics are showing declining returns across SaaS. Assess which apply to {{company_name}}.

| Dying Tactic | Why It's Dying | What to Replace It With | Relevant to {{company_name}}? |
|-------------|----------------|------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Spray-and-pray paid at broad targeting | CPMs rising, conversion declining, AI eating organic clicks | Intent-based targeting, AI-optimized bidding, brand search | {{relevant_1}} |
| Top-of-funnel SEO for traffic volume | AI Overviews cannibalize 40-60% of informational clicks | GEO optimization for AI citation | {{relevant_2}} |
| Gated content lead gen (ebook downloads) | <3% of MQLs convert to pipeline; wastes sales time on low-intent | Ungated content that builds brand, capture intent signals instead | {{relevant_3}} |
| Generic persona-based campaigns | Static personas can't compete with real-time intent signals | Behavioral/intent-based targeting using first-party data | {{relevant_4}} |
| Trade show booths without ABM strategy | $30-100K per event with unmeasurable ROI | Hosted dinners / roundtables with 20 ICP-fit accounts ($5-10K) | {{relevant_5}} |
| Display advertising (non-retargeting) | <0.1% CTR, brand safety issues, mostly bot traffic | Invest in owned media (podcast, newsletter, community) | {{relevant_6}} |
| Cold email blast outbound | Deliverability collapsing, spam filters tightening, buyer tolerance at zero | Warm outbound (engage on social first, then email with context) | {{relevant_7}} |

<!-- AGENT: For each tactic, mark as Yes (currently doing this), No (not applicable), or Partial.
     For each "Yes", quantify the current spend if possible. -->

## Kill Framework — Channel Assessment

For each channel, answer the 4 questions. Score 0 (bad) or 1 (good) per question. Channels scoring 0-1 → KILL. Scoring 2 → Optimize 90 days. Scoring 3-4 → Scale.

| Channel | CAC Trending Down? | Tier 1 ICP Fit? | Retention vs Avg? | Compounding Asset? | Score (/4) | Verdict |
|---------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|-------------------|------------|---------|
<!-- AGENT: One row per active channel. Pull CAC trend from cac-audit output.
     Pull ICP fit from channel-scoring output. Calculate retention comparison from CRM data. -->
| {{channel_1}} | {{cac_trend_1}} | {{icp_fit_1}} | {{retention_1}} | {{compound_1}} | {{score_1}} | {{verdict_1}} |
| {{channel_2}} | {{cac_trend_2}} | {{icp_fit_2}} | {{retention_2}} | {{compound_2}} | {{score_2}} | {{verdict_2}} |
| {{channel_3}} | {{cac_trend_3}} | {{icp_fit_3}} | {{retention_3}} | {{compound_3}} | {{score_3}} | {{verdict_3}} |
| {{channel_4}} | {{cac_trend_4}} | {{icp_fit_4}} | {{retention_4}} | {{compound_4}} | {{score_4}} | {{verdict_4}} |
| {{channel_5}} | {{cac_trend_5}} | {{icp_fit_5}} | {{retention_5}} | {{compound_5}} | {{score_5}} | {{verdict_5}} |
| {{channel_6}} | {{cac_trend_6}} | {{icp_fit_6}} | {{retention_6}} | {{compound_6}} | {{score_6}} | {{verdict_6}} |

### Verdicts

- **Score 0-1 → KILL** — Stop spending immediately
- **Score 2 → Optimize** — Aggressively optimize for 90 days, then re-evaluate
- **Score 3-4 → Scale** — Channel is healthy, increase investment

## Reallocation Recommendations

<!-- AGENT: For each killed channel, specify where to redirect the budget.
     Prioritize reallocation to Tier A channels from the channel efficiency scorecard. -->

| Killed Channel | Monthly Spend Freed | Reallocate To | Rationale |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------|-----------|
| {{kill_channel_1}} | {{freed_budget_1}} | {{reallocate_to_1}} | {{rationale_1}} |
| {{kill_channel_2}} | {{freed_budget_2}} | {{reallocate_to_2}} | {{rationale_2}} |
| {{kill_channel_3}} | {{freed_budget_3}} | {{reallocate_to_3}} | {{rationale_3}} |

## Budget Impact Summary

| Category | Amount |
|----------|--------|
| Total budget freed from killed channels | {{total_freed}} |
| Reallocated to Tier A channels | {{reallocated_tier_a}} |
| Reallocated to Tier B optimization | {{reallocated_tier_b}} |
| Reserved for new channel tests | {{reserved_testing}} |
| Expected blended CAC impact | {{expected_cac_impact}} |

<!-- AGENT: Calculate the expected impact on blended CAC if the killed channel budget
     is reallocated to channels with better unit economics. Show the math. -->
