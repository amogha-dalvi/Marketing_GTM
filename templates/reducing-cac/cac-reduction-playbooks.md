## Playbook 1: The Zero-Cost Flywheel

<!-- AGENT: Customize this blueprint based on the company's available channels.
     Remove stages that don't apply. Add company-specific details to each stage. -->

```
Zero-Cost Flywheel Blueprint:

Stage 1: COMMUNITY & FOUNDER CONTENT (from Brand Strategy)
│   Founder shares practitioner insights on LinkedIn, Twitter, podcasts
│   Community discussions generate organic engagement
│   Cost: Time only (founder + 1-2 hours/day)
│
├──→ Stage 2: EARNED MEDIA & SOCIAL PROOF
│    Community members share and amplify content
│    Journalists/analysts discover thought leadership
│    G2/Capterra reviews grow organically
│    Cost: Zero incremental
│
├──→ Stage 3: GEO CITATION & AI VISIBILITY (from GEO Optimizer)
│    AI models cite your content in answer layers
│    Brand appears in AI-generated recommendations
│    Organic discovery bypasses paid channels entirely
│    Cost: Covered by Content Engine investment
│
├──→ Stage 4: ORGANIC INBOUND
│    Prospects arrive pre-educated, pre-sold on your approach
│    Sales cycle is shorter (60-70% of paid-sourced deals)
│    Close rate is higher (2-3x vs. cold outbound)
│    CAC: Near zero (no media spend, no SDR cost)
│
└──→ COMPOUNDS: Each stage feeds the next, building
     an organic growth engine that gets cheaper over time
     while paid channels get more expensive.

### Flywheel Assessment

<!-- AGENT: For each stage, assess the company's current maturity (Not Started / Early / Active / Mature)
     and identify the single highest-leverage action to advance to the next level. -->

| Stage | Current Status | Highest-Leverage Action | Expected CAC Impact |
|-------|---------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Community & Founder Content | {{stage1_status}} | {{stage1_action}} | {{stage1_impact}} |
| Earned Media & Social Proof | {{stage2_status}} | {{stage2_action}} | {{stage2_impact}} |
| GEO Citation & AI Visibility | {{stage3_status}} | {{stage3_action}} | {{stage3_impact}} |
| Organic Inbound | {{stage4_status}} | {{stage4_action}} | {{stage4_impact}} |

## Playbook 2: Conversion Rate Optimization (CRO)

Better conversion = lower CAC at the same spend level. A 2x improvement in conversion rate cuts CAC in half.

### Website Conversion

<!-- AGENT: Check each item against the company's current site. Mark as Done, Needs Work, or Not Started. -->

- [ ] Homepage headline matches ICP pain (from Positioning & Messaging)
- [ ] Social proof above the fold (customer logos, metrics)
- [ ] CTA is specific and low-friction ("See it work" > "Request demo")
- [ ] Page load <3 seconds (every second costs ~7% conversion)
- [ ] Mobile experience optimized (50%+ traffic is mobile)
- [ ] Remove navigation distractions on landing pages
- [ ] Add live chat / AI chatbot for immediate engagement

### Demo/Trial Conversion

- [ ] Demo request form is <5 fields (every field reduces conversion ~10%)
- [ ] Trial signup requires email only, progressive profiling after
- [ ] Immediate value delivery in first session (time-to-value <5 min)
- [ ] Onboarding sequence activated within 1 hour
- [ ] Follow-up within 5 minutes of demo request (speed-to-lead)

### Lead-to-Customer Conversion

- [ ] Sales follows messaging framework from Positioning & Messaging
- [ ] Battlecards used consistently from Sales Enablement
- [ ] Sales has case studies per ICP segment (from Content Engine)
- [ ] Objection handling documented and trained
- [ ] Multi-threading into accounts (champion + economic buyer)

### CRO Impact Estimate

<!-- AGENT: Based on current conversion rates and which items are not yet done,
     estimate the CAC reduction from implementing the top 3 CRO priorities. -->

| CRO Priority | Current Rate | Target Rate | Estimated CAC Impact |
|-------------|-------------|-------------|---------------------|
| {{cro_priority_1}} | {{current_rate_1}} | {{target_rate_1}} | {{cro_impact_1}} |
| {{cro_priority_2}} | {{current_rate_2}} | {{target_rate_2}} | {{cro_impact_2}} |
| {{cro_priority_3}} | {{current_rate_3}} | {{target_rate_3}} | {{cro_impact_3}} |

## Playbook 3: ICP Precision Impact on CAC

Tighter ICP targeting = higher conversion at every stage = dramatically lower CAC.

| Action | CAC Impact | How | Estimated Impact for {{company_name}} |
|--------|-----------|-----|--------------------------------------|
| Exclude Tier 3 / off-ICP from paid targeting | -20-30% CAC | Remove low-fit firmographics from ad audiences | {{estimated_impact_1}} |
| Build lookalike audiences from best customers | -15-25% CAC | Upload Tier 1 customer list, let platforms find similar | {{estimated_impact_2}} |
| Add negative keywords/exclusions | -10-20% CAC | Block irrelevant searches from triggering ads | {{estimated_impact_3}} |
| Score inbound leads before sales engagement | -15-20% CAC | Only route ICP-fit leads to AEs, nurture the rest | {{estimated_impact_4}} |
| Align content to Tier 1 pain points specifically | -10-15% CAC | Stop writing generic content, write for best-fit buyers | {{estimated_impact_5}} |

<!-- AGENT: For each action, assess whether the company is already doing this,
     and if not, estimate the specific dollar impact based on their current CAC numbers. -->

## Playbook 4: Sales Cycle Reduction

Every day in the sales cycle adds cost. SDR/AE time is the hidden CAC multiplier.

| Tactic | Cycle Reduction | Source | Applicable? |
|--------|----------------|--------|-------------|
| Better qualification at first touch | -20-30% cycle | ICP scoring from ICP Definition | {{applicable_1}} |
| Send case study for their segment before demo | -10-15% cycle | Content Engine | {{applicable_2}} |
| Multi-thread from day 1 (champion + buyer) | -15-25% cycle | Sales Enablement | {{applicable_3}} |
| Mutual action plan from first meeting | -10-20% cycle | Pipeline Accelerator | {{applicable_4}} |
| Address objections proactively in deck | -10-15% cycle | Positioning & Messaging | {{applicable_5}} |
| Interactive product demo (not just slide deck) | -15-20% cycle | Product Marketing | {{applicable_6}} |

<!-- AGENT: Mark each tactic as Already Doing / Quick Win / Requires Setup / Not Applicable.
     Calculate estimated days saved and resulting CAC reduction for the top 3. -->

### Sales Cycle Impact Estimate

| Tactic | Current Cycle | Estimated Reduction | CAC Savings |

| {{tactic_1}} | {{current_cycle}} days | {{reduction_1}} days | {{savings_1}} |
| {{tactic_2}} | {{current_cycle}} days | {{reduction_2}} days | {{savings_2}} |
