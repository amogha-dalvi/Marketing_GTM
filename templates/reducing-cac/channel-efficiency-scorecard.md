## Scoring Dimensions

Each channel is scored 1-5 on 8 dimensions, multiplied by the weight. Maximum composite score: 115.

| Dimension | Weight | What You're Measuring | 1 (Worst) | 5 (Best) |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------|-----------|----------|
| CAC Efficiency | 5x | Lower CAC = higher score | CAC >3x blended | CAC <0.5x blended |
| LTV:CAC Ratio | 4x | Higher ratio = higher score | <1:1 | >5:1 |
| Scalability | 3x | Can you 3x spend and maintain efficiency? | No scale path | Proven 3x potential |
| Speed to Revenue | 3x | How fast from first touch to closed deal? | >6 months | <30 days |
| ICP Precision | 3x | Does this channel attract Tier 1 ICPs? | <20% Tier 1 | >80% Tier 1 |
| Compounding Returns | 2x | Does investment build an asset or evaporate? | Stops when spend stops | Asset compounds indefinitely |
| Attribution Clarity | 1x | Can you clearly measure performance? | No attribution possible | Full-funnel tracking |
| Competitive Saturation | 2x | How crowded is this channel? | Highly saturated, rising costs | Low competition, blue ocean |

## Channel Scoring Matrix

<!-- AGENT: Score each channel 1-5 on each dimension based on CAC audit data.
     Multiply each score by the weight. Sum for total. Remove channels the company doesn't use. -->

## Tier Classification

| Tier | Score Range | Action | Channels |
|------|------------|--------|----------|
| **Tier A — Invest** | 80+ | Increase budget, increase effort, scale aggressively | {{tier_a_channels}} |
| **Tier B — Optimize** | 60-79 | Keep running, run optimization experiments | {{tier_b_channels}} |
| **Tier C — Test** | 40-59 | Small budget experiments only, prove efficiency or kill | {{tier_c_channels}} |
| **Tier D — Kill** | <40 | Stop spending, reallocate budget to Tier A/B | {{tier_d_channels}} |

## Investment Recommendations

<!-- AGENT: For each tier, recommend specific actions:
     - Tier A: How much to increase budget, what to test for scaling
     - Tier B: What optimization experiments to run in 90 days
     - Tier C: What specific test to run, what success looks like, when to kill
     - Tier D: How much budget to free up, where to reallocate -->

### Tier D — Kill These

## Key Insights

<!-- AGENT: Write 3-5 insights based on the scoring patterns.
     Look for: channels with high CAC efficiency but low scalability (hidden gems),
     channels with high spend but low composite score (budget drains),
     compounding channels that are underinvested. -->
