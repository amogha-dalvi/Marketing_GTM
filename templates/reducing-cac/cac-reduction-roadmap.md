> Generated: {{date}} | Skill: reducing-cac | Phase: CAC Reduction Prioritization

## Executive Summary

<!-- AGENT: Write 2-3 sentences summarizing the top 3 initiatives selected,
     expected combined CAC impact, and the 90-day timeline structure. -->
{{executive_summary}}

---

## Prioritization Matrix

Score each initiative 1-5 on each dimension. Multiply by weight. Sum for total. Max score: 75.

| Initiative | CAC Impact (5x) | Effort (5x, inverse) | Speed to Results (3x) | Confidence (2x) | **Total (/75)** | Priority |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------------|----------------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
<!-- AGENT: Score each initiative based on the company's specific data from previous phases.
     Effort is inverse-scored: 5 = easy, 1 = very hard. -->

## Prioritization Rules

- Start with the highest-scoring initiative
- Never run more than 3 CAC optimization experiments simultaneously
- Each experiment gets a 90-day window and a clear success metric
- If an initiative doesn't show measurable CAC improvement in 90 days, kill it or iterate
- Quick wins (score >50, effort score >4) should be shipped within 2 weeks

---

## Quick Wins

<!-- AGENT: List any initiatives scoring >50 with effort >4. These ship in 2 weeks.
     For each, specify the exact first step and expected impact. -->

| Initiative | Score | First Step | Expected Impact | Ship By |
|-----------|-------|------------|-----------------|---------|
| {{quick_win_1}} | {{qw_score_1}} | {{qw_step_1}} | {{qw_impact_1}} | {{qw_date_1}} |
| {{quick_win_2}} | {{qw_score_2}} | {{qw_step_2}} | {{qw_impact_2}} | {{qw_date_2}} |
| {{quick_win_3}} | {{qw_score_3}} | {{qw_step_3}} | {{qw_impact_3}} | {{qw_date_3}} |

---

## 90-Day Roadmap

<!-- AGENT: Select top 3 initiatives from scoring. Schedule across 3 x 30-day sprints.
     Quick wins go in Sprint 1. Larger initiatives span sprints. -->

| Week | Initiative | Owner | Success Metric | Status |
|------|-----------|-------|----------------|--------|
| **Sprint 1 (Days 1-30)** | | | | |
| 1-2 | {{sprint1_initiative_1}} | {{owner}} | {{metric}} | {{status}} |
| 2-4 | {{sprint1_initiative_2}} | {{owner}} | {{metric}} | {{status}} |
| **Sprint 2 (Days 31-60)** | | | | |
| 5-6 | {{sprint2_initiative_1}} | {{owner}} | {{metric}} | {{status}} |
| 7-8 | {{sprint2_initiative_2}} | {{owner}} | {{metric}} | {{status}} |
| **Sprint 3 (Days 61-90)** | | | | |
| 9-10 | {{sprint3_initiative_1}} | {{owner}} | {{metric}} | {{status}} |
| 11-12 | {{sprint3_initiative_2}} | {{owner}} | {{metric}} | {{status}} |

## 30-Day Review Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Day 30

| Question | Answer | Decision |
|----------|--------|----------|
| What is the current blended CAC? | {{day30_cac}} | |
| Have quick wins shipped? | {{day30_quick_wins}} | |
| Is Sprint 1 initiative showing early signal? | {{day30_signal}} | |
| Any initiatives to kill or pivot? | {{day30_kills}} | |

<!-- AGENT: At each checkpoint, compare current CAC to baseline from the audit.
     If CAC has improved, continue. If flat, investigate. If worse, diagnose root cause. -->

**Decision criteria:** If blended CAC has not improved by at least 5% → investigate whether initiatives are being executed correctly or need pivoting.

### Checkpoint 2: Day 60

| Question | Answer | Decision |
|----------|--------|----------|
| What is the current blended CAC? | {{day60_cac}} | |
| Sprint 1 initiative result (final)? | {{day60_sprint1}} | |
| Sprint 2 initiative showing early signal? | {{day60_signal}} | |
| Should any initiative scope change? | {{day60_changes}} | |

**Decision criteria:** If blended CAC has not improved by at least 10% → consider killing underperforming initiatives and doubling down on what's working.

### Checkpoint 3: Day 90

| Question | Answer | Decision |
|----------|--------|----------|
| What is the current blended CAC? | {{day90_cac}} | |
| Total CAC improvement from baseline? | {{day90_improvement}} | |
| Which initiatives delivered measurable impact? | {{day90_winners}} | |
| What should the next 90-day plan focus on? | {{day90_next}} | |

**Decision criteria:** Run a full CAC audit refresh (Phase 1) to establish new baseline and plan the next optimization cycle.

## Next Steps

<!-- AGENT: Based on the roadmap, recommend:
     1. When to re-run the full reducing-cac workflow (typically after 90 days)
     2. Which adjacent skills to run next (e.g., growing-nrr if expansion is a lever)
     3. Any structural changes needed (attribution setup, tool investments, headcount) -->
